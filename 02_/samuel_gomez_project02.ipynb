    "In this project, you'll work with text data from newsgroup posts on a variety of topics. You'll train classifiers to distinguish posts by topics inferred from the text. Whereas with digit classification, where each input is relatively dense (represented as a 28x28 matrix of pixels, many of which are non-zero), here each document is relatively sparse (represented as a bag-of-words). Only a few words of the total vocabulary are active in any given document. The assumption is that a label depends only on the count of words, not their order.\n",

    "ANSWER:\n",
    "* Why doesn't k-Nearest Neighbors work well for this problem?  \n",
    "The k-nearest neighbors algorithm relies on similar data points being close to one another.  This relationship is difficult to maintain as the number of dimensions increases.  This is often referred to as the Curse of Dimensionality.  k-nearest neighors does not perform well because as the number of dimensions increase, the closest distance between two points approaches the average distance between points.  Being that k-nearest neighbors requires points to be close in every single dimension, it is not ideal for this application\n",
    "\n",
    "* Why doesn't Logistic Regression work as well as Naive Bayes does?  \n",
    "When working with a sparse data set, logistic regression is not the most favorable classifier.  It also performs better when a lot of data is available.  In this example, the Naive Bayes model performs better over logistic regression.  However, if more data were available, the results may differ.  This also goes to show the Naive Bayes can perform well/decent on a small data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* What is the relationship between logistic regression's sum of squared weights vs. C value?  \n",
    "The sum of squared weights and c-value are positively correlated.  As the c-value increases, the sum of squared weights increases.  Recall that L2 regularization adds a penalty equal to the square of the magnitude of the coefficient.  L2 regularization does not eliminate coefficients; as L1 regularization does, it only reduces the magnitude.  The cost function controls the trade-off between fitting the training data well and keeping the parameters small to avoid overfitting the data.  I observed that as the c-value increased, the f1-score also increased, until a certain point, then it started to decrease.  \n",

    "Surprisingly, some of the bigram features tend to be more or less generic.  For example, \"you are\" and \"are you\" are the highest predictors for atheism.  It is also surprising that this inverse bigram made the top five predictors for the atheism topic.  I was expecting the features to be more specific to the topic.  Features \"the moon\" and \"sci space\" for topic space are more of what I had in mind for topic-specific top features.  Moreover, it's interesting that the same feature, \"cheers kent\" is a high predictor for two topics--two opposing topics at that (relgion vs. atheism).  Also, I never would have guessed that features like \"the fbi\" (topic religion) and \"and such\" (topic space) have the highest weights out of all the bigram features."

    "The idea of regularization is to avoid learning very large weights (which are likely to fit the training data, but not generalize well) by adding a penalty to the total size of the learned weights. Logistic regression seeks the set of weights that minimizes errors in the training data AND has a small total size. The default L2 regularization computes this size as the sum of the squared weights (as in Part 3 above). L1 regularization computes this size as the sum of the absolute values of the weights. Whereas L2 regularization makes all the weights relatively small, L1 regularization drives many of the weights to 0, effectively removing unimportant features.\n",

    "ANSWER:  \n",
    "The models using reduced vocabulary generally perform worse than the models with full vocabulary.  Let's compare two examples:  C=0.5 for the full vocabulary model has an f1-score of 0.7085, while the reduced vocabulary model has an f1-score of 0.6715 and a vocabulary size of 739.  C=1 for the full vocabulary model has an f1-score of 0.6944, while the reduced vocabulary model has an f1-score of 0.6802 and a vocabulary size of 1169.  This goes to show that a model using 95 - 97% less words can be fairly close in performance.  It is worth noting that as the vocabulary increases, the gap between performance decreases."

    "The TfidVectorizer scores better, at 0.7598, than the CountVectorizer, which scores 0.6824.  Recall that the CountVectorizer creates a matrix of token counts from text documents.  It is a basic count of the number of times each token (word) appears.  The TfidVectorizer, on the other hand, uses a weighting of term-frequency times inverse document-frequency.  This differentiating characteristic does not allow tokens that appear frequently but provide little meaning to overshadow the frequency of rarer yet more significant features.\n",
    "\n",
    "The R ratio divides the maximum probability predicted for each text document by the probability of the actual label for that text document.  If the text document is classified correctly, the R ratio is one, which is the lowest value for the R ratio.  If the text document is classified incorrectly, the R ratio will be greater than one. Suppose the actual label probability is less than but close to the maximum probability; in this case, the R ratio will be greater than one but smaller than if the correct label probability was much smaller than the maximum probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the examples we looked at, a high R ratio describes a scenario where the document is incorrectly classified because the meaningful tokens in the document appeared less frequently than several other words that were good/decent predictors of another topic.  Document 665, for example, is actually labeled talk.religion.misc but classified as comp.graphics because \"Moron\" is mention once while tokens like \"ftp\", \"site, \"internet\" take away from the context.  \n",
    "\n",
    "One suggestion to address the religion topic's misclassification is using a trigram vectorizer.  This may cause the classifier to recognize the phrase \"book of moron\" as highly associated with the topic of religion.\n",
