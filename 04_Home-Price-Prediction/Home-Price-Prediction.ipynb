of feature engineering as well.  Although there is certainly room to address distribution and skewness of additional features, we are quite satisfied with our linear model regression techniques.  Although we only ranked ~ 2000, because of the way Kaggle scores only half the test set prior to the close of the competition, we feel confident a good portion of the higher-ranked models will suffer from overfitting.\n","\n","Overall, we included six models in our project：LinearRegression, LR with outlier removed, LR with features with correlation above 0.5, Lasso and Enet, as well as XGBoost. \n","\n","Additional model comparison with pros and cons can be found in the associated slide deck.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"ftoj5r7xaVEs"},"source":[""],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
